# About
Descent is an underwater exploration game that I'm solo developing using Unity. The most recent major release is Version 0.4.

The goal of this project is to amplify people's interests with one of my personal passions, marine biology through games. Instead of designing a horror or survival game as underwater games tend to be, Descent is designed to be peaceful, simple, and beautiful.

# Development
Descent is being developed using Unity 2022.2.9 (Universal Render Pipeline) on macOS.

The main languages used in development are:
- C# (Both Mono & .NET)
- HLSL (Shading Language).
  - Some HLSL files were also generated using Shader Graph.
- Swift (used in SceneKit testing).
- Metal (used in SceneKit testing).
