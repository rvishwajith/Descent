# Development
I'm developing this project using Unity 2023.3 (URP) for Mac. Detailed notes of the project's development history is available at [UpdateNotes.md](/UpdateNotes.md).

## Target Platforms
The target platforms are **iOS**, **iPadOS**, & **macOS**. 

## Programming Languages
The main programming languages being used are:
- C# 9 (Mono & .NET)
- HLSL/ShaderLab (for shaders or Shader Graph custom functions).
**Note: Some Swift/Metal was used for iOS SceneKit testing and may still be present.**
