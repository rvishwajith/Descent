# About
Descent is an underwater exploration and puzzle game which I am solo-developing.

My goal is to amplify people's interests with one of my personal passions, marine biology through games. Instead of designing a horror or survival game as underwater games tend to be, Descent is designed to be peaceful, simple, and beautiful. Players can learn about and interact with dozens of underwater species and ocean biomes through an entertaining and relazing medium.

## Development
Descent is being developed using Unity 2022.2.9 (Universal Render Pipeline) on macOS.
The main languages used in development are:
- C# (Both Mono & .NET)
- HLSL (Shading Language).
  - Some HLSL files were also generated using Shader Graph.
- Swift (used in SceneKit testing).
- Metal (used in SceneKit testing).

## Platforms
The target platforms for release are **iOS**, **iPadOS**, & **macOS**. Standard mouse and touch input are used, so Android and Windows are possible release targets as well.
